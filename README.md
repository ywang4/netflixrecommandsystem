# Movie Recommendation System using python

## Description
1. Implemented two versions of the basic user-based collaborative filtering algorithm as the cosine similarity method and Pearson Correlation method. Based on pearson correlation method, implement two modifications: 1) Inverse user frequency; 2) Case modification.

2. Implemented the item-based collaborative filtering algorithm based on adjusted cosine similarity.

3. Implemented the user-based collaborative filtering algorithm based on euclidian similarity.

## Things to be proved
1. Use cross validation to train algorithms
2. Use ensembled algorithms
